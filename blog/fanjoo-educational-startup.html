  <div class="fr-view u-clearfix u-rich-text u-text u-block-dca4-4"><p style="text-align: left;">"Fanjoo" revovles around the idea of giving everyone the chance to make money from what they learn, instantly.</p><p>For this matter to happen, we started developing a so-called web-based platform in which you could share your skills, your experience in a field, or even your mom's delicious cookies recipies in the form of short videos and-or series of them in a row.</p><p>What differed from what other platforms like YouTube or KhanAcademy was the foundamental openness to every single person contributing in the teaching process while also beeing obligated by Fanjoo to teach something in return as well.</p><p>The business plan was simply based on these:&nbsp;</p><p>First, a place for people to upload their knowledge - Not neccessarily academical, but strictly observed by the admins for no spam or wrong info policy.</p><p>Second, gamifying the platform by taking and recieving scores, which turn into actual money after some specific conditions, from us.</p><p>So these will ultimitly result in encouraging people to engage - It's a trade-off: whether you would like to learn something new and you want it for free or not. If yes, then give the whole Fanjoo community, the oppurtunity to learn something from you, whatever it is that may be useful.</p><p>However, after having deep investigations around the whole need for learning or choosing career paths, finding out about each and every major and job, while helping individuals to know them selves better, all in one place, became the first priority.</p><hr><ul><li><h5><span style="font-weight: 700;">History</span></h5></li></ul><p>Fanjoo was founded in April 2020 (During COVID-19 lockdown) by Mahta Akhyani and Mr. Parsa Mashayekh through a telegram channel, and then nourished by 5 other talented students.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="np://user.desktop.nicepage.com/Site_1285306829/images/Screenshot2022-07-31194218.jpg" width="620" style="width: 346px;" class="fr-dib fr-fic"></p><p>We managed to have our weekly meetings on Skype, giving updates on what we have done during the week and what are we up to next. I was in charge of managing the scheduals for assigned tasks and extra meetings. Also, after 3 months, I had one-on-one meetings with each of my teammates each day to evaluate the mental state of each individual towards Fanjoo, what we have done, and most importantly, each person's goals and future view and expectations from this startup as a bussiness; All for getting to know them better and help making a more harmonic interaction in the team to increase performance and satisfaction during our time together as colleagues.</p><p>After a while we splited up to a tech team leaded by me and a social networks-marketing team with Sara in charge. Our group was mostly focused on developing the web platform ( HTML-CSS-JS + Django REST) while all 6 of us engaging in weekly brain stormings to mature the idea concerning the new circumstances.</p><p>Unfortunately, Fanjoo was called off in Jan 2021, due to some resource limitations.</p><hr><ul><li><h5><span style="font-weight: 700;">Team</span></h5></li></ul><p>Mahta Akhyani (CTO) <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">- Chemical Engineering @ University of Tehran</span></p><p>Sara Shoarinejad (Project Managing &amp; intrepernuer Team Leader)<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">&nbsp;- Industrial &nbsp;Engineering @ &nbsp;K.

Honestly, I was mostly overwhelmed by this huge mist of "unknowns" around each and every step of the way, which I was trying to lead my team through. As the person who felt the responsibilty to be the one who stays put along the path, it was such a burdon not being sure about any descision all along.</p><p>On the other hand, having the chance to be a part of the team with many enthusiastic, skilled, and active individuals was - and is - one of the best pros of starting an at least tried to be-startup. I learned a lot of things about planning a business, digital marketing, entrepernureship and so on from my teammates.</p><p>Aditionally, watching my friends rise and flourish by finding out their true passions, or some activity they didn't know they would enjoy, still warms my heart. I'm truly happy that I have had even a small positive impact on their lives.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
